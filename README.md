How to Play

The game will ask whether you want to play against the AI or another player.

Then, youâ€™ll choose your marker ('X' or 'O').

Players take turns entering a number from 1 to 9 to place their marker on the board.

The board updates after each move.

The game ends when one player wins or all cells are filled (draw).

After the game ends, you'll be prompted whether to restart or exit.
